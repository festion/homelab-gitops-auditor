# GitOps Audit Procedures

Use this prompt for comprehensive GitOps compliance auditing using the homelab-gitops-auditor project.

## Audit Scope & Objectives

When conducting a GitOps audit, focus on these key areas:

### 1. Repository Structure Compliance
Evaluate how well repositories follow GitOps principles:

**Directory Organization**:
- Is configuration separated from application code?
- Are environments clearly defined and separated?
- Is there a clear hierarchy for different service types?
- Are sensitive data and secrets properly excluded?

**File Naming & Conventions**:
- Do files follow consistent naming patterns?
- Are configuration files properly structured (YAML, JSON)?
- Is versioning information clearly indicated?
- Are documentation files present and up-to-date?

### 2. Configuration Management Assessment
Review configuration practices:

**Declarative Configuration**:
- Are all configurations declared explicitly?
- Is the desired state clearly documented?
- Are configurations version controlled?
- Can the entire system be reconstructed from Git?

**Environment Isolation**:
- Are different environments properly separated?
- Is configuration promotion clearly defined?
- Are environment-specific values properly managed?
- Is there clear traceability between environments?

### 3. Security & Compliance Review
Assess security posture:

**Secret Management**:
- Are secrets properly excluded from version control?
- Is there a clear secret management strategy?
- Are access controls appropriate for each environment?
- Is secret rotation properly documented?

**Access Controls**:
- Are repository permissions appropriate?
- Is branch protection properly configured?
- Are deployment permissions restricted?
- Is audit logging enabled and monitored?

### 4. Deployment Pipeline Evaluation
Review deployment automation:

**Continuous Delivery**:
- Is deployment automation comprehensive?
- Are rollback procedures clearly defined?
- Is deployment status properly monitored?
- Are deployment gates appropriate?

**Testing Integration**:
- Are automated tests integrated into the pipeline?
- Is configuration validation automated?
- Are security scans included in the process?
- Is manual approval required where appropriate?

## Audit Execution Process

### Step 1: Initial Repository Scan
```bash
# Run comprehensive audit
./scripts/comprehensive_audit.sh

# Generate detailed report
node api/server.js --audit-mode

# Export results for analysis
curl http://localhost:3000/api/export/csv > audit_results.csv
```

### Step 2: Manual Repository Review
For each repository in scope:

**Repository Metadata**:
- Repository name and description
- Last activity date
- Number of contributors
- Branch structure
- Tag/release strategy

**Configuration Analysis**:
- Configuration file count and types
- Secret detection results
- Dependency analysis
- Security vulnerability scan

**GitOps Compliance Score**:
- Declarative configuration score
- Environment separation score
- Documentation completeness score
- Security compliance score

### Step 3: Detailed Analysis

**Automated Checks**:
- Run all available audit scripts
- Validate YAML/JSON syntax
- Check for hardcoded secrets
- Analyze file structure patterns
- Verify branch protection rules

**Manual Verification**:
- Review deployment procedures documentation
- Validate environment promotion process
- Check disaster recovery procedures
- Assess monitoring and alerting setup

### Step 4: Risk Assessment

**Critical Issues**:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Exposed secrets or credentials
- Missing branch protection
- Uncontrolled deployment access

**High Risk**:
- Inconsistent configuration patterns
- Missing environment separation
- Inadequate documentation
- No rollback procedures

**Medium Risk**:
- Inconsistent naming conventions
- Missing automated testing
- Incomplete monitoring
- Outdated dependencies

**Low Risk**:
- Documentation gaps
- Minor structure inconsistencies
- Missing optional metadata
- Performance optimizations

## Reporting Framework

### Executive Summary Format
```markdown
# GitOps Audit Report - [Date]

## Overall Assessment
- **Repositories Audited**: X
- **Overall Compliance Score**: Y%
- **Critical Issues Found**: Z

## Key Findings
1. [Primary finding with impact assessment]
2. [Secondary finding with impact assessment]
3. [Additional significant findings]

## Recommendations
1. [Highest priority recommendation]
2. [Secondary recommendations]
3. [Long-term improvements]
```

### Detailed Technical Report
For each repository:

**Compliance Scorecard**:
- Configuration Management: X/100
- Security Posture: X/100
- Documentation Quality: X/100
- Deployment Automation: X/100
- Overall Score: X/100

**Issue Breakdown**:
- Critical: X issues
- High: X issues
- Medium: X issues
- Low: X issues

**Specific Recommendations**:
- [Actionable items with priority and effort estimates]

### Trend Analysis
Track improvements over time:

**Historical Comparison**:
- Compare current scores with previous audits
- Identify improvement trends
- Highlight regression areas
- Track issue resolution rates

**Benchmark Analysis**:
- Compare against industry standards
- Identify best practices from high-scoring repos
- Set realistic improvement targets
- Plan remediation timelines

## Continuous Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Setup nightly audits
crontab -e
# Add: 0 2 * * * /opt/gitops-auditor/scripts/nightly-email-summary.sh

# Configure email notifications
./scripts/email-notifications.js --setup

# Setup dashboard monitoring
systemctl enable gitops-dashboard
```

### Key Performance Indicators
Track these metrics regularly:

**Compliance Metrics**:
- Overall compliance score trend
- Number of repositories meeting standards
- Time to resolve critical issues
- Configuration drift detection

**Security Metrics**:
- Secret detection incidents
- Security vulnerability counts
- Access control compliance
- Audit log completeness

**Operational Metrics**:
- Deployment success rates
- Rollback frequency
- Mean time to recovery
- Documentation completeness

## Remediation Guidance

### Priority-Based Remediation
1. **Immediate (Critical)**: Security issues, exposed secrets
2. **Short-term (High)**: Configuration inconsistencies, missing automation
3. **Medium-term (Medium)**: Documentation gaps, optimization opportunities
4. **Long-term (Low)**: Best practice improvements, advanced automation

### Implementation Support
- Provide specific configuration examples
- Recommend tools and automation
- Suggest training and education needs
- Plan phased implementation approach

Use this framework to ensure comprehensive and consistent GitOps auditing across all repositories and environments.
