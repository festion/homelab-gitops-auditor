# Home Assistant Config Automated Deployment Project

## Overview
This project extends the homelab-gitops-auditor platform to provide automated deployment capabilities for the home-assistant-config repository, eliminating the need for manual deployment processes.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the home-assistant-config repository has a validation-only CI/CD pipeline that checks YAML syntax and Home Assistant configuration validity but requires manual deployment to production. The existing `sync_home_assistant.sh` script has Samba mount issues that prevent reliable automated deployment.

## Solution Approach
Leverage the existing homelab-gitops-auditor infrastructure and MCP server integrations to create a robust, automated deployment system that:
- Integrates with the existing CI/CD validation pipeline
- Uses MCP servers for secure, reliable deployment operations
- Provides comprehensive monitoring and rollback capabilities
- Maintains audit trails for all deployment activities

## Key Benefits
- **Eliminates Manual Deployment**: Fully automated deployment triggered by successful CI/CD validation
- **Improved Reliability**: Robust error handling and automatic rollback on failure
- **Centralized Monitoring**: Integration with GitOps dashboard for deployment status tracking
- **Enhanced Security**: Secure deployment using MCP server network-fs integration
- **Comprehensive Auditing**: Complete audit trail for all deployment activities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Framework for adding automated deployment to other repositories

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Automated deployment of home-assistant-config to production Home Assistant instance
- Integration with existing GitOps auditor dashboard
- Deployment status monitoring and reporting
- Rollback capabilities with automatic backup creation
- Webhook-based deployment triggers
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails

### Out of Scope
- Changes to Home Assistant core configuration
- Migration of existing Home Assistant data
- Multi-environment deployment (staging, development)
- Real-time configuration validation beyond existing CI/CD

## Success Criteria
1. **Automated Deployment**: Successful deployment triggered automatically after CI/CD validation passes
2. **Zero Downtime**: Deployment process maintains Home Assistant availability
3. **Reliable Rollback**: Automatic rollback capability on deployment failure
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Deployment status visible in GitOps dashboard
5. **Audit Compliance**: Complete audit trail for all deployment activities
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with appropriate notifications

## Architecture Overview
The solution leverages existing homelab-gitops-auditor components:
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Repository operations and webhook handling
- **Network-FS MCP Server**: Secure file system operations replacing Samba
- **GitOps Dashboard**: Deployment monitoring and control interface
- **Audit Infrastructure**: Deployment tracking and reporting

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Core deployment script and MCP integration
- **Phase 2**: CI/CD pipeline integration and webhook setup
- **Phase 3**: Dashboard monitoring and API endpoints
- **Phase 4**: Security hardening and comprehensive testing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Deployment Failures**: Automatic rollback with backup restoration
- **Service Disruption**: Pre-deployment health checks and validation
- **Security Concerns**: Secure authentication and encrypted communications
- **Audit Compliance**: Comprehensive logging and audit trail maintenance
