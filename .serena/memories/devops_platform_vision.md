# DevOps Platform Vision for Homelab GitOps Auditor

## Strategic Vision
The homelab-gitops-auditor project is evolving into a **complete DevOps platform** for managing and auditing local repositories in homelab environments.

## Core Platform Capabilities
- **Repository Health Monitoring**: Current audit functionality
- **CI/CD Pipeline Management**: Orchestrate workflows across multiple repos
- **Quality Gate Enforcement**: Automated linting, testing, and validation
- **Cross-Repository Coordination**: Manage dependencies and deployments
- **Workflow Standardization**: Deploy consistent CI/CD patterns across repos

## Current Implementation Focus
- **Target Repository**: home-assistant-config (separate from homelab-gitops-auditor)
- **Workflow Type**: Combined YAML Lint + Home Assistant Config Validation
- **Platform Integration**: Use homelab-gitops-auditor to monitor and manage this workflow

## Multi-Repository Management Strategy
- **Central Orchestration**: homelab-gitops-auditor manages workflows across all repos
- **Standardized Patterns**: Deploy consistent CI/CD configurations
- **Quality Enforcement**: Ensure all repos meet quality standards
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Track workflow health across the entire homelab ecosystem

## Technical Approach
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Repository operations and workflow management
- **Code-linter MCP**: Quality validation across all repositories
- **Serena Orchestration**: Coordinate complex multi-repo operations
- **Audit Integration**: Track workflow health in the central dashboard
