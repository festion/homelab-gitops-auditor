# WikiJS Agent Monitoring Architecture

## System Overview

The WikiJS agent monitoring system provides comprehensive visibility into the health, performance, and operational status of the WikiJS integration infrastructure. This includes monitoring the WikiJS AI agent, MCP servers, document processing pipelines, and all related services.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Services Monitoring
- **WikiJS AI Agent**: Main application health and performance
- **WikiJS MCP Server**: MCP protocol communication and tool execution
- **Document Scanner**: File system scanning and document discovery
- **AI Content Processor**: AI-enhanced document processing
- **Database Layer**: SQLite database operations and integrity
- **Network Services**: API endpoints and external service connectivity

### 2. Infrastructure Monitoring
- **System Resources**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **File System**: Document repositories and processing directories
- **Process Health**: Service uptime and restart tracking
- **Network Connectivity**: External service availability (WikiJS server, AI APIs)

### 3. Application Metrics
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing times, queue depths, throughput
- **Business Metrics**: Documents processed, upload success rates, error rates
- **Quality Metrics**: AI processing quality scores, enhancement success rates
- **User Experience**: Response times, operation success rates

### 4. Alerting and Notification
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Email, Slack, dashboard alerts
- **Escalation Policies**: Progressive alerting based on severity and duration
- **Alert Correlation**: Intelligent grouping of related alerts
- **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing for common issues

### 5. Data Storage and Retention
- **Time Series Database**: Metrics storage with configurable retention
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with search and analysis
- **Historical Analysis**: Trend analysis and capacity planning
- **Data Export**: Integration with external monitoring systems
