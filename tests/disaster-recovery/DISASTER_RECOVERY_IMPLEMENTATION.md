## Recovery Objectives

### Defined Thresholds
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 30 minutes for complete system restoration
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour maximum data loss
- **Data Integrity**: 95% minimum integrity score
- **Success Rate**: 99% recovery success rate
- **Availability**: 99% minimum availability during failures

### Compliance Validation
- Custom Jest matchers for RTO/RPO compliance
- Automated threshold validation
- Comprehensive compliance reporting
- Trend analysis and recommendations

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Failure Simulation
- **Hardware Failures**: Complete system crashes
- **Network Issues**: Partitions, isolation, latency
- **Storage Problems**: Corruption, exhaustion, failures
- **Performance Issues**: Memory leaks, CPU exhaustion
- **Configuration Errors**: Corruption, invalid syntax

### 2. Recovery Validation
- **Data Integrity**: Checksums, file validation, database consistency
- **Performance Metrics**: Recovery time, throughput, availability
- **Business Continuity**: User experience, transaction integrity
- **Compliance**: RTO/RPO adherence, regulatory requirements

### 3. Automated Reporting
- **Real-time Metrics**: Collection during test execution
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Trend analysis and performance tracking
- **Compliance Reports**: RTO/RPO compliance monitoring
- **Recommendations**: Automated improvement suggestions

### 4. Test Isolation

npm run test:disaster-recovery

# Monitor test progress
tail -f tests/disaster-recovery/logs/test-execution.log

# Generate final report
npm run test:disaster-recovery:report
```

### Custom Test Scenarios
```javascript
// Example custom test scenario
const { FailureInjector } = require('./utils/failure-injector');
const { RecoveryValidator } = require('./utils/recovery-validator');

describe('Custom Disaster Recovery Scenario', () => {
  it('should handle custom failure scenario', async () => {
    const failureInjector = new FailureInjector();
    
    // Inject custom failure
    const failureId = await failureInjector.injectServiceFailure('api', 'slow');
    
    // Validate recovery
    const validator = new RecoveryValidator();
    const results = await validator.validateRecovery();
    
    expect(results.success).toBe(true);
    expect(results.rtoCompliance).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

- ✅ 13 test files covering all disaster recovery scenarios
- ✅ 3 utility classes for failure injection, recovery validation, and metrics collection
- ✅ Complete test environment setup and teardown
- ✅ Integration with Jest testing framework
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting and analytics
- ✅ CI/CD integration ready

This implementation satisfies all requirements from the original specification and provides a robust foundation for disaster recovery testing and validation.
