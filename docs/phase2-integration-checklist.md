## Critical Integration Questions Answered

### 1. How does the template engine report progress?
**Current State**: CLI-based logging to stdout/stderr  
**Phase 2 Enhancement**: Real-time WebSocket events with structured progress data
- `template:application:progress` events with step-by-step updates
- Dashboard progress bars and status indicators
- Error handling with automatic rollback notifications

### 2. What events can trigger pipeline runs?
**Identified Triggers**:
- Template application completion (`template:application:completed`)
- GitHub webhook events (push, PR, release)
- Manual pipeline execution from dashboard
- Scheduled pipeline runs (cron-like triggers)
- Quality gate failures requiring remediation

### 3. How are template applications tracked?
**Current State**: File-based logging and backup metadata  
**Phase 2 Enhancement**: Database-backed tracking with:
- `template_applications` table for persistent storage
- Real-time status updates via WebSocket
- Dashboard visibility with filtering and search
- Historical analysis and reporting

### 4. What metrics are currently collected?
**Current Metrics**:
- Repository health status (clean, dirty, missing, extra)
- Template application success/failure rates
- Backup creation and validation status
- MCP server response times

**Phase 2 Additions**:
- Pipeline execution metrics
- Quality gate pass/fail rates
- Template compliance scores
- User interaction analytics

### 5. How can we extend the audit report structure?
**Extension Points**:
- Add `template_compliance` field to repository entries
- Include `pipeline_status` for active pipelines
- Add `quality_gates` results summary
- Include `last_template_applied` metadata
