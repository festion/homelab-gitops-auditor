# Phase 2: DevOps Platform Core Features

## Overview

Phase 2 transforms the homelab GitOps auditor into a comprehensive DevOps platform with real-time monitoring, security integration, and automation capabilities.

**Timeline**: 2 weeks following Phase 1B completion
**Focus**: Real-time infrastructure, security scanning, and automation

## Key Components

### Real-time Monitoring (Week 1)
- WebSocket-powered dashboard updates
- Live CI/CD pipeline status monitoring
- Performance metrics with alerting
- Health status aggregation

### Security Integration (Week 1)
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Security policy enforcement
- Compliance monitoring
- Threat detection and reporting

### Automation Engine (Week 2)
- Cross-repository workflow orchestration
- Dependency management
- Self-healing infrastructure
- Issue detection and resolution

## Technical Architecture

Building on Phase 1B foundation:
- Template application engine (completed)
- MCP server integration framework
- Configuration standardization
- Batch processing capabilities

Enhanced with:
- Real-time WebSocket infrastructure
- Security scanning integration
- Cross-repository automation
- Performance monitoring system

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 Targets
- Real-time dashboard with sub-2-second updates
- Security scanning across all repositories
- WebSocket reliability >99%
- Automated vulnerability reporting

### Week 2 Targets
- Cross-repository automation operational
- Self-healing >80% success rate
- Predictive alerting system
- Zero manual intervention for standard operations

## Implementation Schedule

**Week 1**: Real-time Infrastructure + Security
- Days 1-2: WebSocket setup and data pipelines
- Days 3-4: Security scanning integration
- Day 5: Testing and validation

**Week 2**: Automation + Production
- Days 1-2: Automation engine development
- Days 3-4: Advanced features and controls
- Day 5: Production preparation

## Resource Requirements

- Primary Developer: Full-time (2 weeks)
- Security Specialist: Part-time consultation
- DevOps Engineer: Deployment support

## Risk Management

- Performance impact mitigation
- Security integration complexity handling
- Automation failure prevention
- Alert fatigue management

## Next Steps

1. User approval of Phase 2 roadmap
2. Resource allocation and scheduling
3. Development environment preparation
