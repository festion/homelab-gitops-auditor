# MCP Server Integration

## Overview

The Homelab GitOps Auditor now includes Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration to replace direct CLI commands with coordinated MCP operations.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GitHubMCPManager** - Main interface for repository operations
2. **SerenaOrchestrator** - Central coordinator for multi-server workflows  
3. **MCPConnector** - Bridge to actual MCP server tools

### Active MCP Servers

| Server | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| GitHub MCP | ✅ Active | Repository operations |
| Filesystem MCP | ✅ Active | File system access |
| Serena MCP | ✅ Active | Orchestration |
| Code-linter MCP | ⏳ Planned | Quality assurance |

## Key Features

- **Orchestrated Repository Operations**: Clone, commit, and manage repos through MCP
- **Quality Gate Integration**: Code validation before commits  
- **Automated Issue Management**: GitHub issues for audit findings
- **Comprehensive Fallbacks**: Graceful degradation when MCP unavailable

## Integration Status

The MCP integration has been successfully implemented and tested:

- ✅ Server starts with MCP initialization
- ✅ GitHub MCP connects and authenticates
- ✅ Filesystem MCP provides file operations
- ✅ Serena MCP coordinates workflows
- ✅ API endpoints use MCP operations
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms work correctly

## Usage

All existing API endpoints now use MCP operations when available, with automatic fallback to direct commands when needed.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: MCP coordination reduces conflicts
2. **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation and quality gates
3. **Better Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and error handling
4. **Future Extensibility**: Easy addition of new MCP servers
