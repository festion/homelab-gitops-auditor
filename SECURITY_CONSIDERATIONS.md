# Security Considerations: Home Assistant Config Automated Deployment

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive security measures for the Home Assistant Config automated deployment system, covering authentication, authorization, data protection, and operational security.

## Threat Model

### 1. Potential Threats
- **Unauthorized Deployment**: Malicious actors triggering unauthorized deployments
- **Configuration Tampering**: Modification of Home Assistant configuration files
- **Credential Exposure**: Exposure of authentication tokens and secrets
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: Interception of deployment communications
- **Privilege Escalation**: Unauthorized access to deployment controls
- **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized access to configuration data
- **Service Disruption**: Attacks targeting Home Assistant availability

### 2. Attack Vectors
- **GitHub Account Compromise**: Compromised GitHub accounts with repository access
- **Webhook Spoofing**: Fake webhook requests triggering deployments
- **API Abuse**: Unauthorized API access and abuse
- **Network Intrusion**: Unauthorized network access to deployment systems
- **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies or tools
- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting deployment personnel

## Authentication and Authorization

### 1. Multi-Factor Authentication
```yaml
# Authentication Strategy
Primary: GitHub OAuth integration
Secondary: Token-based API authentication
Emergency: Time-limited emergency access tokens

# Token Types
- Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for GitHub integration
- API Bearer tokens for deployment operations
- Webhook secret tokens for GitHub webhook validation
- Emergency access tokens with limited scope and duration
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```json
{
  "roles": {
    "deployment-admin": {
      "permissions": [
        "deployment:read",
        "deployment:write",
        "deployment:rollback",
        "deployment:admin"
      ],
      "description": "Full deployment management access"
    },
    "deployment-operator": {
      "permissions": [
        "deployment:read",
        "deployment:write",
        "deployment:rollback"
      ],
      "description": "Deployment operations access"
    },
    "deployment-viewer": {
      "permissions": [
        "deployment:read"
      ],
      "description": "Read-only deployment access"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Token Management
```javascript
// Token Security Requirements
const tokenSecurity = {
  generation: {
    algorithm: 'crypto.randomBytes',
    length: 32,
    encoding: 'base64url'
  },
  storage: {
    method: 'encrypted-database',
    encryption: 'AES-256-GCM',
    keyRotation: '90-days'
  },
  transmission: {
    protocol: 'HTTPS-only',
    headers: 'Authorization: Bearer',
    logging: 'token-hash-only'
  },
  expiration: {
    default: '24-hours',
    maximum: '7-days',
    emergency: '1-hour'
  }
}
```

## Network Security

### 1. Network Segmentation
```yaml
# Network Architecture
Internal Network: 192.168.1.0/24
  - GitOps Auditor: 192.168.1.58
  - Home Assistant: 192.168.1.155
  - Network isolation with firewall rules

External Access:
  - GitHub webhooks via HTTPS
  - Secure VPN for remote management
  - No direct internet access to Home Assistant
```

### 2. Firewall Configuration
```bash
# Firewall Rules
# Allow GitHub webhook access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3070 -s 140.82.112.0/20 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3070 -s 185.199.108.0/22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow internal network access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3070 -s 192.168.1.0/24 -j ACCEPT

# Allow Home Assistant API access
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 8123 -d 192.168.1.155 -j ACCEPT

# Block all other external access
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3070 -j DROP
```

### 3. TLS/SSL Configuration
```nginx
# Nginx TLS Configuration
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
ssl_session_timeout 10m;
ssl_stapling on;
ssl_stapling_verify on;

# Security Headers
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
```

## Data Protection

### 1. Encryption at Rest
```yaml
# Data Encryption Strategy
Configuration Files:
  - Home Assistant configuration encrypted on disk
  - Backup files encrypted with AES-256
  - Database encryption for deployment logs

Secrets Management:
  - GitHub tokens encrypted in secure storage
  - API keys encrypted with separate key management
  - Webhook secrets rotated regularly
```

### 2. Encryption in Transit
```yaml
# Communication Security
GitHub API: HTTPS with certificate pinning
Home Assistant API: HTTPS with self-signed certificates
Internal Communications: TLS 1.3 minimum
Backup Transfer: Encrypted file transfer protocols
```

### 3. Backup Security
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Secure Backup Implementation
create_secure_backup() {
    local backup_file="/tmp/config-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz"
    local encrypted_backup="/backup/config-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz.enc"
    
    # Create compressed backup
    tar -czf "$backup_file" -C /config .
    
    # Encrypt backup with GPG
    gpg --cipher-algo AES256 --compress-algo 1 --symmetric --output "$encrypted_backup" "$backup_file"
    
    # Secure cleanup
    shred -u "$backup_file"
    
    # Set secure permissions
    chmod 600 "$encrypted_backup"
    chown root:root "$encrypted_backup"
}
```

## Operational Security

      "reason": "automated-deployment",
      "skipHealthCheck": false,
      "createBackup": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Security Monitoring
```javascript
// Security Monitoring Implementation
const securityMonitoring = {
  rateLimit: {
    threshold: 10,
    window: '1-minute',
    action: 'block-ip'
  },
  authentication: {
    failureThreshold: 3,
    lockoutDuration: '15-minutes',
    alerting: 'immediate'
  },
  deployment: {
    unauthorizedTriggers: 'alert-immediately',
    failedDeployments: 'alert-after-3-failures',
    rollbackRequests: 'alert-always'
  },
  webhooks: {
    invalidSignatures: 'alert-immediately',
    unknownSources: 'block-and-alert',
    rateLimiting: 'progressive-blocking'
  }
}
```

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### 1. Webhook Validation
```javascript
// GitHub Webhook Validation
const validateGitHubWebhook = (payload, signature) => {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', process.env.GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  
  const receivedSignature = signature.replace('sha256=', '');
  
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature, 'hex'),
    Buffer.from(receivedSignature, 'hex')
  );
};
```

### 2. Configuration Validation
```javascript
// Configuration File Validation
const validateConfiguration = (configData) => {
  const schema = {
    repository: /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\/[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/,
    branch: /^[a-zA-Z0-9/_-]+$/,
    commit: /^[a-f0-9]{7,40}$/,
    author: /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$/
  };
  
  // Validate against schema
  // Sanitize input data
  // Check for malicious patterns
  // Validate file paths and names
  
  return sanitizedConfig;
};
```

### 3. Path Traversal Prevention
```javascript
// Secure Path Handling
const securePath = (inputPath) => {
  // Remove dangerous characters
  const sanitized = inputPath.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._/-]/g, '');
  
  // Prevent path traversal
  const normalized = path.normalize(sanitized);
  
  // Ensure path is within allowed directory
  const basePath = '/config';
  const fullPath = path.join(basePath, normalized);
  
  if (!fullPath.startsWith(basePath)) {
    throw new Error('Path traversal attempt detected');
  }
  
  return fullPath;
};
```
